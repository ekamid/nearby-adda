<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Nearby Adda is a web-based application that enables users to explore social gatherings and events in their vicinity. The app utilizes location-based services to display a list of events within a specific radius of the user's location.

Registered users can create their own events or join existing events created by others. The app provides various filters and sorting options for users to customize their event search based on their interests, date, time, and location.

Once registered, users can also chat with other participants in the event to communicate and coordinate any changes or updates. Whether it's a social event, a business meetup, or a hobby group, Nearby Adda makes it easy for users to find and connect with people who share similar interests.

With its intuitive interface and easy-to-use features, Nearby Adda is a valuable tool for anyone looking to explore social events and gatherings in their local area.
